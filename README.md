### imacec_sarima
An intent to understand how imacec behaves by using sarima as a process (more than a forecasting tool). A nice conclusion is that we're too dependent on mining operations held in chile and well, we grow slow as fuck - to not say that we don't actually grow. That arises the question... Then if we don't grow but the PIB is advertised to do it, then that doesn't mean that out "Long Tail" is getting longer every day?
